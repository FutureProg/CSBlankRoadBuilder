Blank Road Builder is a Cities: Skylines mod that allows you to create roads without dealing with the tedious asset editor!

This mod automatically generates the properties, lanes, props & models of the road based on a configuration created in Thumbnail Maker.

## Features

- Easily create road configurations using Thumbnail Maker.
- Automatically generate the model of the road for any width needed.
- Road markings are dynamically created using customisable presets.
- Props are automatically generated based on the road.
- Lots of customisations available with AN toggles.

## Installation

The solution can be run without any additional setup if you have the Cities: Sylines game installed on your computer.

If not, you'll need to copy the missing dll files from the game's managed folder into the libs folder inside the project.

Building the project will automatically copy over all the needed files into the game's mods folder.
All you need to do is go in-game and enable it.
